## Week 5

### Part 2 (ggplot2)

In this part of the activity, you will use the summary data includned in this 
repo to reproduce the plot in each question using ggplot. The data represents
summary results from an analysis of the 2015 RECS data comparing the proportion
of homes with internet access by Urban (including Urban Cluster) and Rural
status within each Census Division. 

Use the provided template [week4_part2_solution.Rmd](week4_part2_solution.Rmd)
to produce your solution. Some preparatory work is done for you to facilitate
plotting, but you may need to make additional changes to the input data 
structure.
